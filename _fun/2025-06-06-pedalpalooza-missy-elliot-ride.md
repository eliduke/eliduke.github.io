  She's back like she never left! After a long hiatus, the Missy Elliott Ride returns to the streets, bigger, louder, and freakier than ever. This is THE premiere hip-hop ride of PedalPalooza—an all-out party on wheels celebrating the genius of Missy "Misdemeanor" Elliott. Expect deep cuts, chart-toppers, collabs, and bass-heavy beats bumping all night long. Led by the legendary Teenage Dirtbag Bike Club, this ride brings the vibes, the volume, and the vibes again. Come dressed to impress, express, and maybe get your freak on. Lights, looks, and loud speakers encouraged. This ride is a no-drop, no-drama, high-energy celebration. We'll be rolling deep and partying hard. All wheels welcome. Get your bikes, your friends, your fits—and let's make it hot!
