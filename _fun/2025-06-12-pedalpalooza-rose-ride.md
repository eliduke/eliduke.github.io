  Ride with us to stop and smell the roses! We'll be riding to rose gardens on the eastside of Portland, rolling down streets where the smells may overtake your senses and the sounds of rose-themed songs and poetry shared will honor our city of roses. Wear your best rose-themed outfits - after all, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Ride is a loop!
