  Tuesdays are the best night of the week at Oaks Park, if you're asking me! The crowds are a bit smaller than a normal Friday or Saturday night, but energy is way up and the vibes are high. You'll see lot of the OGs, the regulars, bladers and beginners, but no kids on Tuesday nights. I try to get out and about for a little pre-party somewhere nearby in Sellwood, usually Kay's Bar, so let me know if you wanna meet-up early!
