  This ride worked out really well two years ago. It's a little different, think of it more as a tour of pizza shops and then a pizza picnic at the end. Come ride your bike and eat pizza. The ride will be touring around town to a handful of pizza shops in the inner SE.  Ride will have 3 planned stops to pick up pizza, so order ahead and line it up with the stop time.
