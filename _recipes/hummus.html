excerpt: "My mom was making hummus way before it was cool: like back in the 80s when you couldn't buy it in stores, and even in the 90s when the store-bought hummus was total crap. She'd always make a double-quadruple batch for long, family road trips."

    <p class="p-summary">My mom was making hummus way before it was cool: like back in the 80s when you couldn't buy it in stores, and even in the 90s when the store-bought hummus was total crap. She'd always make a double-quadruple batch for long, family road trips.</p>
    <p class="p-summary">I'm pretty sure it all started with the recipe from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Tao-Cooking-Sally-Pasley/dp/0253212375" title="The Tao of Cooking">The Tao of Cooking</a>, but it has evolved over time. The best part is how ding dang simple it is to make! You throw everything in the food processor for a couple minutes and it's done. Boom.</p>
    <p class="p-summary">The one thing to be extra careful with is the salt. It seems like I end up putting in a little less or a little more each time I make it. Feel free to add more salt to taste, but it's always best to start with less. Also, don't be afraid to experiment: this is the base, the foundation. It's <b>delicious</b> as is, but try throwing in a couple tablespoons of Sriracha or something. Get Wild.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li class="p-ingredient">2 cans of chickpeas</li>
      <li class="p-ingredient">1 jar of tahini</li>
      <li class="p-ingredient">1 cup of lemon juice</li>
      <li class="p-ingredient">4 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
      <li class="p-ingredient">1 teaspoon of salt</li>
      <li class="p-ingredient">3 teaspoons of cumin</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol class="e-instructions">
      <li>Open the cans of chickpeas and strain the liquid into a cup for later.</li>
      <li>Put the chickpeas, lemon juice, garlic, salt, and cumin into the food processor and let her rip for about a minute.</li>
      <li>Put the tahini into the food processor and rip it for another minute.</li>
      <li>While the food processor is processing, slowly add chickpea juice until your hummus reaches your desired consistency. Keep in mind that it will thicken up a bit after it's been in the fridge for a day or two.</li>
    </ol>
