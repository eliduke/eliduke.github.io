    <p>Don't underestimate how nice it is to pull some <em>chilled</em> tapioca pudding out of the fridge on a hot day.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li class="p-ingredient">3 cans coconut milk (1200ml)</li>
      <li class="p-ingredient">3/4 cup <em>small pearl</em> tapioca</li>
      <li class="p-ingredient">2/3 cup sugar</li>
      <li class="p-ingredient">1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li class="p-ingredient">1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol class="e-instructions">
      <li>Blend the coconut milk... because it usually has settled a bunch in the can and it's so annoying to try to whip out later so, just empty/scrape all the cans of coconut milk into a blender, buzz it for a minute, and you are good to go.</li>
      <li>Mix the all the tapioca and (super smooth and blended) coconut milk in a medium saucepan and let soak for 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Mix the sugar and salt into the tapioca mixture and then heat over medium heat until it is simmering pretty good.</li>
      <li>Reduce heat to low/med and let simmer for 15 minutes until tapioca pearls are transparent and the mixture has thickened. <strong>BE CAREFUL</strong>: keep an eye on things and stir frequently to avoid those little tapiocas getting stuck on the bottom of the pan.</li>
      <li>Remove from heat and mix in vanilla</li>
      <li>Pour into cups, bowls, pyrex, whatever you got lying around</li>
      <li>Let sit on the counter for 30 minutes or so and then put them in the fridge</li>
      <li>Pat yourself on the back!</li>
    </ol>

    <p>This is recipe was heavely influenced by a recipe from <a href="https://prettysimplesweet.com/coconut-tapioca-vegan/" target="_blank">Pretty Simple Sweet</a>. I adjusted some measurements to better fit my needs, but it's essentially the exact same recipe. Photos are all mine.</p>
