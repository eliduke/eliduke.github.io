    <p class="p-summary">I've been looking for a super simple, good-enough-for-who-its-for salsa recipe for a while now, and I think I have finally found it! It's all pretty basic ingredients that you can find at most markets or groceries. Sometimes a can of fire-roasted tomatoes can be a little bit hard to come-by, but it really does tie it all together.</p>
    <p class="p-summary">And, to be honest, this isn't the best salsa I've ever had, but it's easy to make and gets more and more delicious the longer it sits in the fridge. It's also a really nice foundation from which to spring forth. It's easy to experiment with, so, go buckwild! Have fun out there, y'all.</p>
