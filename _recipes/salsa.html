    <p class="p-summary">I've been looking for a super simple, good-enough-for-who-its-for salsa recipe for a while now, and I think I have finally found it! It's all pretty basic ingredients that you can find at most markets or groceries. Sometimes a can of fire-roasted tomatoes can be a little bit hard to come-by, but it really does tie it all together.</p>
    <p class="p-summary">And, to be honest, this isn't the best salsa I've ever had, but it's easy to make and gets more and more delicious the longer it sits in the fridge. It's also a really nice foundation from which to spring forth. It's easy to experiment with, so, go buckwild! Have fun out there, y'all.</p>
    <p class="p-summary">After making this recipe about half a dozen times, it was time to take some pics and make the it official here on my website. But, silly me, I bought all the ingredients for the salsa, and then totally forgot to get chips! Thankfully there was some focaccia lying around, and let me tell you that shit was delicious. Brought back memories of <em>pan con tomate</em> I had in Barcelona a couple years ago. Truly amazing stuff.</p>
