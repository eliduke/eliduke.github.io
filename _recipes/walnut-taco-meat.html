excerpt: "The first time I ever had this recipe, a friend made it for a party at her house because she wanted to make sure there was something vegan for me. Bless her heart. She served it up with fresh endive for dipping, and it totally blew my mind. The flavors, the textures, the mouth feel: it was all so spot on."
