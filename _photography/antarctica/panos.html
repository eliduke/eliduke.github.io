<p><i>24 October 2022</i> - Loading up in the C-17 Globemaster, about to depart on a 5-hour flight from Christchurch, NZ to McMurdo Station, Antarctica. The flight crew is based out of JBLM (near Tacoma, WA) and they deploy to Antarctica every year as part of Operation Deep Freeze. If you look closely at the jacket hanging on the back of the chair (just right of center), you will see a blue and white patch that says ICE.</p>

<p><i>25 October 2022</i> - I arrived just one day after the last sunset before summertime. This is the view of McMurdo Station from up on the hill at the Carpentry Shop at 11pm with Mount Discovery as the highest point on the horizon. The sun never got lower than this all summer, until it finally set again 4 months later in late February.</p>

<p><i>5 November 2022</i> - A view of Cape Royds with the southernmost established Adelie penguin colony on the left, which at the time had many hundreds of penguins squawking and waddling all around. You can see the discoloration in the rock from all their feathers and droppings. On the right you will see Shackleton's Hut, built in 1908, which housed at least half a dozen men during that winter. The Royal Society Mountain Range is across open water on the horizon.</p>

<p><i>5 November 2022</i> - Another view of Cape Royds from the other direction, this time with the Shackleton's Hut on the left and the Adelie penguin colony on the right. Also, Mount Erebus, the southernmost active volcano in the world, can be seen towering in the background, puffing steam at 14,000 feet. Shackleton's Hut was the source of the 100-year-old whiskey that was found under the floor boards in 2006.</p>

<p><i>6 December 2022</i> - A view of the wide expanse that is McMurdo Station. From this perspective, looking generally to the south, you can see wind generators on the ridge to the left and Observation Hill prominently in the center. On the far right is Hut Point, and if you look very closely you can see Discovery Hut that was built in 1902. In the distance on the horizon, you can see White Island on the left and Black Island on the right, with Phoenix Airfield as just a couple tiny specs between them.</p>

<p><i>13 December 2022</i> - Massive snow drifts after a huge storm at WAIS Divide, deep in Western Antarctica. On the left you can see about a dozen tents evenly spaced as part of a temporary tent city, and on the right you can see one of the carpenters exploring the drifts where snow piled up behind modular buildings during the storm. The wind always blows in the same direction out there.</p>

<p><i>16 December 2022</i> - One of the British Antarctic Survey Twin Otter planes parked for the night at WAIS Divide. On either end of the frame you can see a carpenter playing tricks on the camera.<p>

<img src="/images/antarctica/panos/antarctica-pano-08.jpg">
<p><i>19 December 2022</i> - A comprehensive view of WAIS Divide camp seen from on top of the modular building that holds the showers and wash facilities, with a Rac-Tent attached on one end. On the left you can see the electrician wiring up the kitchen module, with a long dining tent attached. On the right are additional tents for medical and other purposes. Midway back and along the horizon are a wide range of cargo lines, some for immediate use and others for longer-term storage.</p>

<p><i>20 December 2022</i> - Exploring the deep winter berms at WAIS Divide. Supplies that are left behind at the end of each summer, like additional fuel and food, are stored high up on snow berms to avoid things getting buried as much as possible. Large snow drifts still pile up over the long nine months of winter.</p>

<p><i>31 December 2022</i> - The annual IceStock Music Festival on New Year's Eve at McMurdo Station. The community really comes together to celebrate with a bunch of live music, a chili cook-off, and dancing. This is the warmest time of the year, so everyone really enjoys being outside in the sunshine.</p>

<p><i>18 January 2023</i> - More panorama shenanigans on the way out to Room With a View. Some lucky few get a special snowmobile trip away from McMurdo Station to a spot with beautiful views of Mount Erebus, which can be seen in the distance on the right.</p>

<img src="/images/antarctica/panos/antarctica-pano-12.jpg">
<p><i>25 January 2023</i> - A view from high up on the ridge at Mount Newall with the Bell 212 helicopter parked on the left, an orange survival cache at center, and the radio repeater module further up the ridge. This repeater transmits data from the instruments at Bull Pass (nearby on the floor of the Wright Valley) back to McMurdo Station.</p>

<p><i>25 January 2023</i> - The floor of the Wright Valley near the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Seismic station (on the far right) at Bull Pass. This seismic station is part of a worldwide network that can detect nuclear and non-nuclear explosions, as well as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and meteor strikes. The data from this station is first sent to the repeater at Mount Newell (pictured above) on it's way back to McMurdo Station. In the distance you can see two people who are checking out a mummified seal that mysteriously undulated itself way up the valley many years ago and died.</p>

<p><i>31 January 2023</i> - Lake Bonney at the western end of Taylor Valley in the McMurdo Dry Valleys. The permanent structures on the lake edge can be seen to the left, and the helicopter landing pad can be seen on the right.</p>

<img src="/images/antarctica/panos/antarctica-pano-15.jpg">
<p><i>5 February 2023</i> - McMurdo Station as seen from on top of Ob Hill late in the summer season. Lots of open water surrounds Hut Point just left of center, and just to the right of that (if you look closely) you can see one of the resupply vessels being unloaded. Just above and to the right of that out in open water (if you look even closer) you can see the US Coast Guard Cutter POLAR STAR heavy icebreaker that journeyed all the way from Seattle, WA to break out a channel in the midseason sea ice.</p>

<img src="/images/antarctica/panos/antarctica-pano-16.jpg">
<p><i>5 February 2023</i> - Another view from on top of Ob Hill, this time with hikers resting before the hike back down.</p>

<img src="/images/antarctica/panos/antarctica-pano-17.jpg">
<p>7 February 2023</i> - Late evening sun at Lake Hoare near the mid-point of Taylor Valley in the McMurdo Dry Valleys. The lake is dammed by the tongue of the Canada Glacier that can be seen on the far left.</p>

<img src="/images/antarctica/panos/antarctica-pano-18.jpg">
<p>7 February 2023</i> - A broad view of the Canada Glacier (mentioned above) near Lake Hoare.</p>

<img src="/images/antarctica/panos/antarctica-pano-19.jpg">
<p>7 February 2023</i> - A comprehensive view of the camp at Lake Hoare with evening shadows. A wide range of structures can be seen that serve mechanical, science, and human needs.</p>

<img src="/images/antarctica/panos/antarctica-pano-20.jpg">
<p>8 February 2023</i> - Another view of the camp at Lake Hoare in the morning light, this time with the massive tongue of the Canada Glacier featured prominently on the right.</p>

<img src="/images/antarctica/panos/antarctica-pano-21.jpg">
<p>10 February 2023</i> - Cargo lines at McMurdo Station with lots of open water in the background.</p>

<img src="/images/antarctica/panos/antarctica-pano-22.jpg">
<p>20 February 2023</i> - A wide view of McMurdo Sound with Black Island, Mount Discovery, and the Royal Society Range in the distance. Late in the summer season, the sun is now setting again even if only for a few minutes in the evening.</p>

<img src="/images/antarctica/panos/antarctica-pano-23.jpg">
<p>22 February 2023</i> - Phoenix Airfield with Ivan the Terra Bus on the left and a C-17 Globemaster being loaded with cargo at center.</p>
