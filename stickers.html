  <h1 class="page-title">Stickers</h1>
	<p>It started in college. At the time I was playing in some punk/rock bands, and it always fell on me (somewhat by choice) to set up the website, print out flyers, and design the stickers. Fast-forward about 10 years: I still make some websites (like this one!), and I still make some stickers (like these!). It's fun: the designing, the printing, and the sticking. I only get the finest fade-proof, scratch-proof, and weather-proof vinyl stickers from <a href="http://stickerguy.com" target="_blank" alt="StickerGuy.com">StickerGuy.com</a>. They are worth every penny.</p>

			<h3>Smilie</h3>
			<img src="{{site.assets}}/stickers/smilie.png">
			<p>This has always been my most favorite emoticon. There's something sorta slanted and silly going on there. It all comes down to the colon being off center, which it actually is when typed out in Helvetica, and that wide open mouth. Homegirl's not just happy, she's super pumped! :D</p>
			<p>Sometimes I carry a couple of these in my wallet and hand them out to strangers or when I'm checking out at the grocery store. I pull my wallet out to get some money and there they are! It usually puts a smile on their face.</p>
			<p>It's also sort of a little logo for me, being a Duke and all.</p>

			<h3>Rest Stop</h3>
			<img src="{{site.assets}}/stickers/rest-stop.png">
			<p>During my travels, I have spent a fair bit of time in New Zealand: hiking, hitch-hiking, campervaning, and ride-sharing. It's a wonderful country to explore if you ever get the chance, and hitch-hiking doesn't get any easier.</p>
			<p>With all that time spent on the road, this sticker is in homage to the wonderful <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/elisfanclub/6209032734" title="New Zealand Rest Stop Sign" target="_blank">New Zealand Rest Stop Sign</a>. Such a solid little tree, and the cutest little table! Looks like a place I wouldn't mind stopping for a rest.</p>

			<h3>GROH UP!</h3>
			<img class="img-responsive" src="{{site.assets}}/stickers/groh-up.png">
			<p>My friend Travis Groh is insanely awesome and awesomely insane. He's always makeing that face and staying up until 4am and then being just as chipper as ever at work at 7:30 the next morning. Sometimes when I'm too tired to party he says, "Come on, Eli! Groh Up!"</p>

			<h3>banjo</h3>
			<img class="img-responsive" src="{{site.assets}}/stickers/banjo1.png">
			<p>Banjo came into our lives unexpectedly and then completely changed what we knew was possible in the world. She was the coolest! She was so gentle and loving but super sassy and totally down for an epic wrestling match. She would come when I whistle, she'd take naps in the middle of the cul-de-sac in front of our house, she'd let you hold her upside down like it ain't no thang, and when I got home from soccer practice I could lie down on the ground and she'd clean my entire head.</p>
			<p>She was the kind of cat that could convert non-cat lovers. She'd walk into the room and do a big circle, usually settling down on the lap of the person who was the least interested. Before long, they'd be petting her and admitting that she was awesome. She lived a long and happy life with us and then died in my mom's arms on the way to the vet to be put down. It was my mom's 65th birthday.</p>

			<h3>THE HOTBOX</h3>
			<img class="img-responsive" src="{{site.assets}}/stickers/hotbox.png">
			<p>During one epic year of my time in Seattle, I was lucky enough to have lived at the HotBox. It was a rag tag group of awesome girls, and yours truly. Some of us were in college, some of us worked at a doggy day care, and some of us were Game Testers at Nintendo, but we all liked to party. And that's what we did. About 5 years later I put together this sticker in commemoration of such wonderful serendipitousness. Each circle is a logo that I used for all of our different party flyers. Good times, ladies. No matter what happens, they can never take that away from us.</p>

			<h3>YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO RIDE</h3>
			<img class="img-responsive" src="{{site.assets}}/stickers/dumb.png">
			<p>I used to work with this guy named Dale. He's a snowmobile mechanic, and he is amazing: such a little fire cracker. I love sassy older men that aren't afraid to dish it out. At one point I asked him if our snowmobile was going to be ready on time and he said NO. I asked him why and he said, "Because you don't know how to ride and you're dumb." It was one of the most epic quotes I'd ever heard.</p>

			<h3>SAFETY FIRST</h3>
			<img class="img-responsive" src="{{site.assets}}/stickers/safety.png">
			<p>I happened across an international sign for "what's inside this electrical box will hurt you" and immediately fell in love. I couldn't help but completely rip it off, with a few little adjustments of my own, and then print that sticker for all my friends.</p>

			<h3>ilDi</h3>
			<img class="img-responsive" src="{{site.assets}}/stickers/ildi.png">
			<p>Ildi is a dear friend of mine. She rocks harder than rocks. She's never afraid to laugh at herself or make really uncomfortable sexual references in front of people she hardly knows. She'll whisper dirty Hungarian words in your ear while humping your leg if you ask nicely. She is positivity incarnate. I never see enough of her.</p>
