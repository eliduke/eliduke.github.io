title: The Long Road to McMurdo
excerpt: The flights from Portland to McMurdo can be pretty brutal, topping out at over 21 hours of actual flight time. Most people go from their AOD (Airport of Departure) to LA or San Francisco, and then the proper long haul flight across the Pacific Ocean. This year I am going from LA to Brisbane, Australia, which is a 14-hour flight all the way to Christchurch, NZ. It adds up to over *21 HOURS* of actualy flight time, which definitey does not include the 13-hour layover that I have in Brisbane, Australia. Absolutely bonkers.
