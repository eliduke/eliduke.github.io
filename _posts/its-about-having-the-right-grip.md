I had 45 matches on Tinder and no one reached out. Girls say that they just like a man that knows what he wants and goes for it, but that's what PEOPLE like. You can't be the only ones that are allowed to like that. You don't got to own "I sit back and look cute and wait for it to come to me."

Also, there's this weird vibe of convincing someone. We see it in the movies and on tv, where a woman is disinterested at first and eventually the man convinces her. And you wonder why men think no means yes? They have been conditioned to think that way. So, a couple NOs is par for the course! If you're a real man, you're supposed to PUSH PAST THAT. And because, in general (we are generalizing here), woman have been condition to "want a man who knows what he wants and goes and gets it," they feel free to basically label man's attention that they are interested in to be that of a creeper.
