I've never really understood what it means to "be a (heterosexual) man." There are physical qualities like being large, with big muscles and thick beard, but none of those really apply to me. There are personality traits like confindence and assertiveness, a general extrovertedness, which I think could apply to me. There are also certain romantic expectations of men, most notably that we are supposed to take charge and "make the move."

But, if I can be so bold, I like to consider myself somewhat of a modern man. I'm not afraid to appear feminine or show my emotions. I'm big movie cryer and pink is one of my favorite colors. I love to go dancing, wear cute clothes, and I have lots of female friends. Many of the people in my life would not be the least bit surprised if I turned out to be gay, but I assure you that I crave only pussy.

And it is in that persuit of women where I am the most conflicted about what it means to be a man. I see so many examples, at bars, in dance clubs, just out and about in the city, of the dispicable ways that men treat women. I see unwanted advances, I see harrasment, I see pestering. That is not the kind of man that I want to be, and so I try to fight that whenever I can. There have been times in my single life where I have decided to forgo that typical male role of move-maker. In my mind, if a women is actually interested, she will make a move. That usually lasts a couple weeks or a month, and then I am reminded that 99% of the time, if I want something to happen I have to make it happen. It's sad, but true.

A long-term relationship of mine ended about 6 months ago and soon there after I joined Tinder. My first experiment with online dating.

I had 45 matches on Tinder and no one reached out. Girls say that they just like a man that knows what he wants and goes for it, but that's what PEOPLE like. You can't be the only ones that are allowed to like that. You don't got to own "I sit back and look cute and wait for it to come to me."

Also, there's this weird vibe of convincing someone. We see it in the movies and on tv, where a woman is disinterested at first and eventually the man convinces her. And you wonder why men think no means yes? They have been conditioned to think that way. So, a couple NOs is par for the course! If you're a real man, you're supposed to PUSH PAST THAT. And because, in general (we are generalizing here), woman have been condition to "want a man who knows what he wants and goes and gets it," they feel free to basically label man's attention that they are interested in to be that of a creeper.
