There's nothing inherently wrong with the standand monogamous relationship. It works for a lot of people in the world, including my grandparents. They were married for over 50 years, and the relationship only ended because my grandmother died of alzheimer's. She was 85 years old. My parents were together for 34 years before they got divorced, which isn't totally unheard of. Their kids were all grown up and had moved out. They'd had a good run and were incredibly awesome parents. It's been almost 5 years since they split up and I think they are both better off because of it.

But, things feel a little different with my generaton. Certainly there are plenty of my peers on facebook posting pictures of their new homes and their spouses and their children. I completely support people following their dreams in whatever form that may be, but that never quite felt right for me, and I know I'm not alone.

For those of us that don't find comfort in the standard monogamous relationship or who haven't find "the one", we usually end up going from one long-term relationship to another hoping to find something that lasts. But I have a hard time even *imagining* a person that I could spend ten, twenty, or thirty years with, let alone **the rest of my life**.

It really does feel like an impossibilty.

As a result I can't help but be very interested in the alternatives. What if the standard monogamous relationship (SMR) just isn't right for me? What if there's a different way to look at this? What are the problems that I see in the SMR? What are some of the alternatives that are already out there?

I've known many people in open relationships of all varieties, and I've even experimented with them a little myself. I dipped a toe in, enough to know that both people have to be completely on-board with the idea and be willing to do a lot of extra work to keep communication open and honest and very real. Open relationships aren't any easier or harder than monogamous relationships, they are just different. Hypothetically I can imagine one that could work for me, but we live in such a monogamous culture that it's like constantly paddling upstream.

Regardless, one of the interesting things about open relationships is that they usually involve much more open and specific rules regarding what is allowed and what isn't. Sometimes it is as simple as "don't ask, don't tell," and sometimes both parties *sign a relationship contract*. There are so many flavors of open relationships and they all comform *specifically* to the people that are in them.

Why can't the same thing be true for monogamous relationships?

<!-- But when I think about monogamous relationships there's so little variation. It's a monogamous relationship and we all know what that means. Certainly there's going to be subtle variations because it involves two unique people, but for the most part they are all pretty much the same. But why? -->

<!-- Just because it's monogamous doesn't mean that the people involved aren't just as unique in their desires as people in open relationships. Just because we are in a monogamous relationship doesn't mean that we want the SMR. -->

Let's all take a moment to be straight-forward and honest with ourselves about what we want in a relationship. I think Hannah Horvath was pretty clear about that when she said:

Here's my idea: the Short Distance Monogamous Relationship (SDMR).

The SDMR is a committed, monogamous relationship with time constraints. It creates specific boundaries around how much time the couple is allowed to spend together in a given week, which forces the individuals involved to spend more time on themselves: quality time with friends, working on personal projects, and maintaining a solid sense of self.

For example: if the couple knows that they have a long weekend planned (a camping trip, a family reunion, a wedding, etc), then they aren't allowed to see each other during the week. It helps to maintain the anticipation and excitment, while also forcing the individuals to use that extra time during the week to catch up with a friend they haven't seen in a while or to finish writing that essay they've been neglecting.

<!-- (friendships, acquaintances, lovers, boyfriends, girlfriends, husbands, wives, etc) -->

If you think about relationships in general, you would never impose such intense time commitments on your friendships. Even the bestest of friends don't spend decades living together, but yet we expect that out of our parters.

Our world is built around the idea that you start slow, seeing someone a couple times a month. You get to know each other better and a real connection begins to develop. You regularly start spending the night at each other's places, but it's usually not considered "serious" until you've moved in together.

But what if you never move in together? What if you intentially keep that physical space between you? There are no rules for how much you are allowed to love the other person or desire them or share your most intense thoughts and feelings. You are free to connect on a very deep level, but you both maintain your independence.
