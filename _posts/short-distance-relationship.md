There's nothing inherently wrong with the standand monogamous relationship. It works for millions of people all around the world. It worked for my grandparents: they were married for over 50 years, and the relationship only ended because my grandmother died of Alzheimer's Disease. She was 85 years old. My parents were together for 34 years before they got divorced. They were incredibly awesome parents and I give them most of the credit when it comes to the successes in my life. It's been about 7 years since they split up, and I think they are both happier because of it.

Though, if I can be so bold as to speak for an entire generation, things feel a little different with my generaton. Certainly I still have lots of friends that are married with children or are well on their way, and I am _SO PUMPED_ to be the cool/weird fruncle (an uncle-y friend) to all the new humans in my life. But I also have lots of friends in their late 30s that aren't married and/or don't have kids. It feels like there's a shift happening.

For those of us that don't find comfort in our society's standard monogamous relationship (_SMR_) or who haven't found "the one", we usually end up going from one long-term relationship to another hoping to find something that lasts. I have a hard time even *imagining* a person that I could spend ten, twenty, or thirty years with.

It really does feel like an impossibilty.

As a result I couldn't help but become interested in the alternatives. What if the SMR just isn't right for me? What if there's a different way to look at this? What are the problems that I see in the SMR? What are some of the alternatives that are already out there?

I've known many people in open relationships of all varieties, and I've even experimented with them a little myself. I dipped a toe in, enough to know that both people have to be completely on-board with the idea and be willing to do a lot of extra work to keep communication open and honest and very real. Open relationships aren't any easier or harder than monogamous relationships, they are just different. Hypothetically I can imagine one that could work for me, but we live in such a monogamous culture that it's like constantly paddling upstream.

Regardless, one of the interesting things about open relationships is that they usually involve more specific rules regarding what is and isn't allowed. Sometimes it's as simple as "don't ask, don't tell," and sometimes both parties *sign a relationship contract*. There are so many flavors of open relationships and they all comform *specifically* to the people that are in them.

> <span id="#one">The history of humanity shows us so many varied approaches to love, so many different assumptions about how couples are supposed to get together and so many distinctive ways of interpreting feelings, we should perhaps accept with a degree of grace that the way we go about our relationships must in practice owe rather a lot to the prevailing environment beyond our bedrooms. Our loves unfold against a cultural backdrop that creates a powerful sense of what is "normal" in love; it subtly guides us as to where we should place our emotional emphases, it teaches us what to value, how to approach conflicts, what to get excited about, when to tolerate, and what we can be legitimately incensed by. Love has a history and we ride – sometimes rather helplessly – on its currents.</span> [[1]("#1")]

*TL;DR*

My new normal is called a Short Distance Relationship.

I need space between me and my partner. Physical space. In my experience, the thing that really kills a relationship is over-exposure. So, let's just bake that in right from the beginning.

The Short Distance Relationship is a committed, monogamous relationship with time constraints. It creates specific boundaries around how much time the couple is allowed to spend together in a given week, which encourages the individuals involved to spend more time on themselves: quality time with friends, working on personal projects, and maintaining a solid sense of self.

I call bullshit on the basic concept that the time you spend with your partner directly corresponds to how much you love each other. What about that old adage, quality over quantity?

> If the couple knows that they have a long weekend planned (a camping trip, a family reunion, a wedding, etc), then they aren't allowed to see each other during the week. It helps to maintain the anticipation and excitment, while also encouraging the individuals to use that extra time during the week to catch up with a friend they haven't seen in a while or to finish writing that essay they've been neglecting.

Why can't that be applied to relationships?

*Why can't the same thing be true for monogamous relationships?*

I realize that every relationship is a multi-layered, unique snowflake, but I know that in my experience the discussion about the specifics of the relationship just weren't specific enough. It's extremely likely that I and my partners are terrible communicators, but we all sort of come by it honestly.

We don't dig in deep enough. We aren't open and honest enough with ourselves and our partners about what we want. We don't color outside the lines when it comes to what is acceptable and normal.

> We should not feel that we are failures, dull-witted, unimaginative or unsophisticated if we recognise a theoretical need to learn how to talk to our partners with premeditation and conscious purpose. We are simply emerging from a Romantic prejudice. [[1]("#1")]

For most of us most of the time, myself included, when a friend starts dating someone new and things progress, and they start calling each other boyfriend and girlfriend, and then maybe they move in together, and then they start alternating holidays between their families: we don't really need to ask.

But when I think about monogamous relationships there's so little variation. It's a monogamous relationship and we all know what that means. Certainly there's going to be subtle variations because it involves two unique people, but for the most part they are all pretty much the same. But why?

Just because it's monogamous doesn't mean that the people involved aren't just as unique in their desires as people in open relationships. Just because we are in a monogamous relationship doesn't mean that we want the SMR.

Let's all take a moment to be straight-forward and honest with ourselves about what we want in a relationship. I think Hannah Horvath was pretty clear about that when she said:

> I just want someone who wants to hang out all the time and thinks I’m the best person in the world and wants to have sex with only me.

Here's my idea: the Short Distance Relationship (SDR).

The SDR is a committed, monogamous relationship with time constraints. It creates specific boundaries around how much time the couple is allowed to spend together in a given week, which forces the individuals involved to spend more time on themselves: quality time with friends, working on personal projects, and maintaining a solid sense of self.

For example: if the couple knows that they have a long weekend planned (a camping trip, a family reunion, a wedding, etc), then they aren't allowed to see each other during the week. It helps to maintain the anticipation and excitment, while also forcing the individuals to use that extra time during the week to catch up with a friend they haven't seen in a while or to finish writing that essay they've been neglecting.

(friendships, acquaintances, lovers, boyfriends, girlfriends, husbands, wives, etc)

If you think about relationships in general, you would never impose such intense time commitments on your friendships. Even the bestest of friends don't spend decades living together, but yet we expect that out of our parters.

Our world is built around the idea that you start slow, seeing someone a couple times a month. You get to know each other better and a real connection begins to develop. You regularly start spending the night at each other's places, but it's usually not considered "serious" until you've moved in together.

But what if you never move in together? What if you intentially keep that physical space between you? There are no rules for how much you are allowed to love the other person or desire them or share your most intense thoughts and feelings. You are free to connect on a very deep level, but you both maintain your independence.

Think about it. If you've ever known someone in an open relationship (or if you can imagine it for a second), the first question most people have revolves around what that means exactly.

*What does "open" mean?*
