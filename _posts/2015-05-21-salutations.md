I'm a big fan of salutations, but sometimes I feel like an old man when I refuse to say "what's up?" to people I'm passing by. It's just never felt genuine. I know that deep down they don't really want to know *what is up* or *how it is going*, they are just saying what everyone says. The problem is that a salutation with a question mark at the end doesn't make a lick of sense.

We've all been there before.

> You're walking down the street or to the bathroom at work, and you pass an aquaintance or maybe a friend and you say "what's up?" and then they say "not much, how about you?" and then you might say "pretty good."

It is *the worst* little conversation in the world, and it happens **MILLIONS** of times everyday. I can't even begin to imagine how much effort and energy is wasted on such dumb and pointless words. And the crazy thing is, we already have words that do the exact same thing while simultaneously leaving "how's it going?" for one of those times when you really actually want to know how it is going.

The next time you find yourself in one of those horrible situations, trapped, feeling like there's no way out, try one of these salutations instead:

* Hello
* Howdy
* Hey there
* Hi there
* Hey
* Good Morning
* Good Evening
* Welcome
