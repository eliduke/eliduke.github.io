  <h1>Words</h1>
  <p>Writing is fun. Just think about all the words there are to choose from! And all the different stories to tell! Yet there's still millions of people that don't consider themselves writers despite the fact that they probably spend countless hours every day on their phones or computer <b>writing</b>. You might not be a published author doing it for a living, but that doesn't mean you aren't a writer. You have a voice! Tell your story! It might not be interesting to everyone, it might seem trivial or tired, but it's still fun and such a treat to look back on years down the road.</p>
