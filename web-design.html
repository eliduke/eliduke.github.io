		<h2><a href="http://chedda.co" target="_blank">Chedda</a></h2>
		<p>Chedda is a super duper simple expense tracker. It does nothing for you, aside from a little bit of math here and there, which gives you complete control. It started out as a proof-of-concept for a few logistical challenges I had rolling around in my brain, but then it ended up being pretty interesting and useful. I originally made it as a single-user platform for myself, but then my girlfriend said she wanted to try using it, and then a couple friends wanted in on the action too. I've got about 10 users right now with nearly $50,000 in tracked expenses. I know. It's kind of a big deal.</p>
		<p>I'm really looking forward to the day when I have a couple years of data to play around with. I daydream about pie charts and line graphs.</p>

		<p>I really enjoy <em>This American Life</em>, but I absolutely hate the podcast subscription service through iTunes. Thankfully the current TAL podcast can be downloaded from their website for free, but I never remember in time and then I'm forced to listen through their weird flash player on their non-mobile-friendly website. Ruby to the rescue! I wrote a couple Nokogiri scripts, wired up an S3 bucket, and now I'm good to go whenever I want.</p>

		<h2><a href="http://poopypants.net" target="_blank">Poopypants</a></h2>
		<p>The story with poopypants.net goes all the way back to the Fall of 2008. I took a picture of a funny little scrap of paper taped on my brother's bathroom wall that somehow turned into my most-viewed photo on Flickr, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/elisfanclub/2908192137/" title="Professor Poopypants's Pocket-Sized 'Name Change-O-Chart 2000'" target="_blank">Professor Poopypants's Pocket-Sized "Name Change-O-Chart 2000"</a>. As an exercise in Ruby programming, I turned that chart into a little ruby script. The website was the logical next step.</p>

		<h2><a href="http://www.listyourlist.com" target="_blank">ListYourList</a></h2>
		<p>I originally built ListYourList in the Spring of 2006 as an exercise in Ruby on Rails. I'd done all the demos and tutorials that I could stand, and it was time to start solving some of my own problems. The idea was for a simple site that might actually end up being interesting at some point. It has had it's tiny little moments in the sun here and there, but mostly it's just a personal project that I keep rebuilding from the ground up hoping that at some point it'll catch on. It's been a few years, and it's screaming for some fresh paint.</p>
