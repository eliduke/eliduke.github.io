  <h1 class="page-title">Welcome!</h1>
  <p>If this is your first time here and you're curious about my time in Antarctica, the best intro to <em>the what</em> and <em>the where</em> and <em>the why</em> and <em>the how</em> is to read the first blog post here:</p>
  <p><strong><a href="/2022/08/05/i-am-going-back-to-antarctica/">I am going back to Antarctica</a></strong></p>
  <p>After that, you can click <a href="/">Home</a> to see the newest posts. I will try to post about once a week, but we shall see how that goes. If you wanna get real old school, you should <a href="/atom.xml">subscribe to my RSS feed</a>. ðŸ¤“</p>
  
  <h3>The Quick &amp; Dirty</h3>
  <p>I will be a Carpenter Apprentice at McMurdo Station, Antarctica, for the (big) austral summer research season from October to February. I will be supporting science through the United States Antarctic Program and the National Science Foundation. I've done five of these stints in the past, and my last season was 10 years ago!</p>

  <h3>Postcards from Antarctica</h3>
  <p>If you want a postcard from McMurdo Station, <a href="mailto:me@eliduke.com?subject=Send me a postcard from Antarctica!">send me an email</a> with your full name and mailing address!
  
  <h3>Contact Info</h3>
  <p>I will have some ability for communication, but the internet is slow and there's no wifi. Everything happens at a computer in a kiosk. I can receive voicemails. I can send and receive basic sms messages.<p>

  <p>Mail is very slow at McMurdo, but it still does find its way eventually. The best bet is to send things via "flat mail," which actually means NO BOXES. You can even send large padded envelopes and those usually get through ok. It is always better to send multiple smaller things than one BIG BOY, and everything needs a customs form so make sure you check with the USPS staff to get the correct form. Also, there is usually a mail slump in the middle of the season (Dec/Jan), get on it if you're gonna do it!<p>
