  <h1>07: Roller Skating</h1>

  <p>I always bring my roller skates with me when I travel, and Antarctica is no exception! But never did I ever think there’d be such a glorious skate spot waaaay the fuck down here in Antarctica. The new pier at Palmer Station is CHOICE. 🤌🏻</p>

  <p>It's a joy having such a big and smooth concrete space for skating. Being surrounded by icebergs and penguins on a warm (32F) sunny day with the cracking sounds of the glacier in the background... what a dream come true!</p>
