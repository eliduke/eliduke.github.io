  <h1 class="text-center mb-5">Hey Fam! Merry Yuletide and Happy Christmas!</h1>

  <p>I wish I could be there with you... all cozied up around the fire, a cup of coffee in one hand, some citrus salad and a t-ring in the other, choral arrangements of our favorite christmas songs on in the background. Oh the joy of it all! I miss you terribly.</p>

  <p>And as you can see by now, I have sent a big ass box full of PALMER STATION MUGS! I couldn't really figure out a way to send different mugs to a bunch of different places, so instead I sent one big box and I'll let y'all figure it out.</p>

  <p class="fw-bold">But first, a little back story!</p>

  <p>When I arrived at Palmer, I was really drawn in by the mural on one of the fuel tanks in town...</p>

  <img src="{{ page.images }}/fuel-tank.jpg">

  <p>It's a little gritty and a little grimy and very much an old-school mural / graffiti that we'd never get approval for around here these days. I'm actually a little surprised it hasn't been painted over yet and turn into something a bit more clean-cut, prim and proper, etc.</p>

  <p>And the thing I like most about the mural is the big and blocky PALMER STATION ANTARCTICA text that the artist laid out. It feels like the artist had a 4-inch roller and just went to town, real quick with it, and then went back around to pop in some shadows.</p>

  <p>So, using that photo as a guide, I went in and digitally traced that part of the mural, so that I could use that text/font in other fun and creative projects. At first it was some landscape photos from around town contrasted with that big and blocky graffiti text...</p>

  <p>I was having lots of fun with it! I put hi-res versions of those photos up on the local cloud storage that we have here so that other people could save them and set them as desktop wallpapers if they want! It's been fun seeing some of them pop up on people's computer screens here and there.</p>

  <p>I kept playing with the design a bit, and then it was time to make a Palmer Station sticker to get sent down here (stickers are all the rage). I wanted to use that text, but I needed something else... a bit more of a Palmer splash to add to the mix. And then one day I was walking between buildings and a Giant Petrel went swooping by at just the right moment...</p>

  <p>I traced the outline, plopped that right down in the middle, and had myself a lil sticker!</p>

  <p>One of the old-timers down here (his name is Moss) loves stickers. He has designed a bunch in the past and also facilitates a big sticker order of a bunch of different designs. It's very sweet. I submitted that design, and so they should be arriving on the boat that I am leaving on! I'll have just a few days to pass out a bunch, stick them on a few things, and then head north. Very excited to share them with my friends down here and other Palmer folks from years past.</p>

  <p>Moss also mentioned the possibility of using a sticker design on a MUG! Wow! I had never considered that. So, I started playing around with another design (the other mug!), but it needed a little something else as well. And then I took this cute lil pic of some Gentoo Penguins.</p>

  <p>And then turned it into a lil design!</p>

  <img src="{{ page.images }}/gentoo-2.jpg">

  <p>I grabbed that lil guy and plopped it down into the other design!</p>

  <p>So there you have it! My custom Palmer Station mugs that I designed. I hope you love them! Please send me a pic or two once you get them opened. I'm really curious to see how they turned out.</p>

  <p>And, I'm not totally sure exactly who wants one and how many I needed, but I ordered a dozen to start with. Obviously, all of y'all get one (happy bday, Cory)! And then one of each design should go to the Beehive. If any of the Beehivers want one for their own personal collection, by all means! When they get back: one for Drew (bday boy) and one for Fanny (bday girl)! And then who knows from there. I'd like to send one of each design BACK TO PALMER so they can add them to the mug collection around here. But I can figure all that out later.</p>

  <p>Anyhooooooo...</p>

  <p>I love you all. I miss you all. I can't wait to be around to celebrate the holidays with you again next year.</p>

  <p>And in the meantime, Merry Yuletide and Happy Xmas from Palmer Station!</p>
