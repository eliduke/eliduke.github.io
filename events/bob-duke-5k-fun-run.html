    <p>That's right all you non-Duke Kids... it's time for the <em>3rd Annual All Non-Duke Kids Bob Duke 5k Memorial Fun Run</em>! It has become such a wonderful springtime tradition for us, and we would love for you to join in the celebration. :)</p>

    <p>Even though it's called a fun "run", running is not the only option! You are more than welcome to run, walk, bike, blade, skate, scoot, or whatever else your heart can dream up.</p>

    <p>Another little twist for this year, we are encouraging folks to wear a MUSTACHE! If you can grow one, get started on it now. If not, we'll have some stick-on staches available. It'll be fun!<p>
      
    <p>We'll be providing pizza, dark beer, and blueberries for refreshments after the race is over.</p>
    
    <h3>WHO?</h3>
    <p>YOU along with any family or friends you want to include, and <strong>*we need you to RSVP with t-shirt sizes*</strong> so we know how many of each size to order. You can message any of the Duke Kids and we'll add you to the list.</p>
