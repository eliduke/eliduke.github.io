          <img class="img-rounded img-responsive" src="handle.jpg">
          <p>The handcrafted, made to order hammers you see above and below can only be purchased from one of our distributors. Different weights and styles are made, in order to ensure the hickory handle guides the hammer in a way that best suits each individual saw filer's hammer strike.</p>

          <img class="img-rounded img-responsive" src="crossface.jpg">
          <p><strong>Cross Face</strong> hammers are primarily used for bandsaws. They are composed of two elongated faces, one parallel to the handle and the other perpendicular.</p>

          <img class="img-rounded img-responsive" src="twist.jpg">
          <p><strong>Twist Face</strong> hammers are typically used for circular saws. Each hammer has two elongated faces which are oriented at 45 degrees to the handle in opposite directions.</p>

          <p>We regrind and manufacture new straight edges, tension gauges, and speed gauges up to 48".</p>
          <p>Straight edges are primarily used in the benching and hammering process for circular saws. These straight edges come in a “roof-top” style with one ground straight edge, or a double-sided style with both sides being ground straight edges.</p>
          <p>Tension Gauges are used in the benching process for bandsaws. They are straight on one edge and convex on the other. The convex edge, or tension edge, is ground to the customer’s specified foot circle.</p>
          <p>Speed gauges are designed to measure the amount of tension in a large circular saw based on their RPM. These gauges are convex on one edge and concave on the other.</p>

          <h1>History</h1>
          <p>Roseburg Saw &amp; Tool Company was originally founded as K &amp; S Precision Grinding in 2002 by Dan Lines. When he started the company, Dan brought twenty-five years of saw filing experience in both primary and secondary manufacturing.</p>
          <p>In 2006, the company relocated to Roseburg, Oregon and began to include service work for the wood products industry in Douglas County. In 2010, K &amp; S Precision Grinding was renamed Roseburg Saw &amp; Tool Company to better reflect the diversity of the products and services provided.</p>
          <p>Ten years later, in 2016, after many years of partnership with Warren Bird and the Bird family, California Saw &amp; Knife Works was added to the Roseburg Saw &amp; Tool Company family of businesses, and both were moved to a larger production facility in Sutherlin, Oregon, creating a unique environment where a saw can go through the full process of being cut out of steel, all the way to being levelled, tipped, and sharpened, all under one roof.</p>
          <p>Acu Saw joined Roseburg Saw &amp; Tool and California Saw &amp; Knife Works in 2018 and is now also manufactured and assembled in Sutherlin. California Saw &amp; Knife has been the sole distributor of the Acu Saw centering adaptors for a long time, so it was an easy decision when Thomas Bonac asked if we would continue building these products after he retired.</p>
