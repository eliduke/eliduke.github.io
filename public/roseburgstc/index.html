          <h1>About Us</h1>
          <span style="font-size: 160%">
            <p>Roseburg Saw &amp; Tool Company was originally founded as K &amp; S Precision Grinding in 2002 by Dan Lines. When starting this company, Dan had twenty-five years of sawfiling experience in both primary and secondary manufacturing in a variety of wood species.</p>
            <p>Our beginning focus was on the sawfiling industry. We provided a source of hand crafted saw hammers, tension gauges, and straight edges.</p>
            <p>In 2006, the company relocated to Roseburg, Oregon and began to include service work for the wood products industry in Douglas County.  In 2010, K &amp; S Precision Grinding was renamed Roseburg Saw &amp; Tool Company in an effort to better reflecting the services we provide.</p>
