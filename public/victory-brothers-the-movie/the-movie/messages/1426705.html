        <p>so, i added some things to the outline that you should all check out.  i&#8217;m actually starting to really wrap my head around some of this and see it as a real story.  i think that if we do it right, it could be really cool.  fyi.</p>

	<p>also, i was thinking that we could possibly get together tomorrow night and have a littel pow wow about all of this before we split up for the holidays.  what do you say, your place tomorrow night?</p>
