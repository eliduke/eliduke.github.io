        <p>So, in an effort to try to get involved I read the &#8220;outline&#8221;.  I read the whole thing, and really still have no idea what the movie is about.  Other than that it has something to do with guys trying to make a sitcom, and the movie seeming to be a random culling of every idea we&#8217;ve had in the last 8 years.  If you guys understand what&#8217;s going on, that&#8217;s great.  But it would probably benefit your writing process if your outline was actually an outline and not a metaphorical pile of post-it-notes.  </p>

        <p>well, at this point, that&#8217;s all that it really is.  it still seems like we are in the very early brain storming session, so, we&#8217;ll get on the outline once things are more certain.</p>

        <p>One more thing&#8230;well, I almost don&#8217;t want to say it because it could be interpreted as negativity (and I just watched Wedding Crashers the other night, and Vince and Owen are successful because they&#8217;re all about staying positive and enthusiastic)&#8212;so don&#8217;t interpret this as negativity.  </p>

	<p>Here&#8217;s the thing though.  Group Projects.  Even drop-outs like Eli remember how much they sucked in college.  The usual reason is because the group members are idiots or have no sense of humor.  But I have always thought there&#8217;s another reason, and I call it &#8220;the committee&#8221;.  </p>

	<p>College projects were, more or less, easy.  So why did they always take so damned long?  Because <em>every</em> little decision, <em>every</em> miniscule change or addition had to go through &#8220;the committee.&#8221;  You have an idea, so you suggest it, but you don&#8217;t want to &#8220;force&#8221; it on the other group members, so you&#8217;re timid&#8212;but the other group members want you to know that they respect your opinion, so they try to include it even if they don&#8217;t like it, but then you say, &#8220;nah, nevermind&#8221; and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;No&#8212;it&#8217;s good, just&#8221; and before you know it 10 minutes have gone by and you&#8217;ve done <span class="caps">SHIT</span>.  At least this is my experience.</p>

	<p>So, to get to my point, here&#8217;s what I think works: you&#8217;ve got a movie with 5 or 6 parts?  And there&#8217;s four of you?  Pick a part&#8212;by yourself&#8212;then get crackin&#8217;.  Write as much as you can by yourself, then, when you&#8217;ve done a good deal of the work, <span class="caps">THEN</span> you show the group and <span class="caps">THEN</span> they critique.  </p>

	<p>You&#8217;ve got to trust that each one of you understands the &#8220;basics&#8221; of what is funny and where it&#8217;s going.  It&#8217;s just tooooo slow to all work together.  Have one person (maybe two) do as much as he can, then pass it on to others to critique.  If you think about, it&#8217;s how 90% of our skits were written.  An individual&#8217;s developed idea brought to group critique.  </p>

	<p>That&#8217;s what I think, anyway: instead of 4 people workin&#8217; on each single decision, get 4 people working on 4 decisions.  </p>

	<p>And, if you like this idea, don&#8217;t just say, &#8220;Yeah, sounds good.&#8221;  Go ahead and assign/choose parts and get to work.  When you get stuck, ask for help, but take it upon yourself to do as much as you can without &#8220;the committee&#8221;.</p>
