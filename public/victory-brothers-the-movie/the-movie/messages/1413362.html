        <p>I&#8217;m sweet with this (by the way, being &#8220;sweet with&#8221; something is a new way to say things are cool. I find it really awesome. I&#8217;m sweet with that new saying). I think it&#8217;s great. Finally, a practical use for the internet. Think of how effective and useful this will be, Eli, when eventually you buy us all our own laptops. It&#8217;ll be awesome.<br />

        <p>well, we&#8217;ll see what comes of it.  i was talking to tyler about this and the possibility of helping us keep things organized and all that crap.  we&#8217;ll see.  but i think that if we really got into it and really used this as a resource it would be very helpful.</p>

        <p>Wunderbar!!  I personally feel like this was such a major step towards the overall making of the project, that we can afford to give ourselves some much earned time off.  how about we regroup in about a week or three, and discuss our next step.  great talk, i&#8217;ll see ya out there.  </p>
