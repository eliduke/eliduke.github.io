        <p>Over break Eli set up a project name for me.  Since I&#8217;m missing all the in-person interactions you guys are working on in Seattown, I&#8217;m not going to, like, make huge alterations to your work.  But maybe I can be helpful as a third-party objective reader&#8212;a third-party who is yet intimately familiar with our past work.  So, you might see a comment or two here or there from the andyman.  Titties!</p>
