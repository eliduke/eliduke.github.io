        <p>This is just really me getting my thoughts square on the immediate supplementary characters. I fleshed them out as I see them (definitely open to suggestions). I gave them as much back story as possible, I think the more we know about these characters, the more legitimately we can plug them into plot points. Plus, these can lead to all manner of flashback/non-sequiter jokes that make characters funnier and more real. Plus, once we are all on the same page as far as the details, our individual first drafts will at least bear some relationship to one another. Also, I’m not sure if Eli, Andy, or Brandon know anything about these characters, even though Tyler and I have talked about them a lot.</p>

	<p>-As far as the supplementary characters, we don’t have names. Off the top of my head, I’m just going to assign some names that I think fit the more fictionalized characters in the show.</p>

	<p>The Network: This is obviously not a character, but I think the nature of the network will be quite important to the show. As I’ve said, I feel like the network should be an upstart spin-off of an already-established network. It feels legitimate enough to warrant our move to Seattle and our expectations about how much money we will make. Because the board of directors who controls the network is woefully out of touch, I think it would be funny if they were tentatively going to call the network “TPTV” which stands for “The Place TeleVision” and their tagline will be “TPTV: It’s The Place.” This network is basically a depository for the mother network’s unwanted, ready-for-syndication programming and a broad selection of rejected pilots and first-time creators. Ideally it would be sort of an incubation network for young directors, writers, and actors, sort of like a television farm league with the larger network retaining rights to anything promising. It is ostensibly billed to the public as very youth-oriented, hip, and cutting edge. </p>

	<p>The Network President: He has worked his whole professional life for the mother network, and just at the peak of his television success, the point at which he felt he was tagged to be part of the network’s upper echelon, he is put in charge of <span class="caps">TPTV</span>. He feels it is a slap in the face and is deeply resentful of everyone at the old network and everyone he is now forced to work with. His first instinct is to intentionally sabotage <span class="caps">TPTV</span>, but as the series continues, I see his character wrestling with a desire to see his little network succeed. This hilariously complicates his relationship with our heroes, whose improving content he comes to begrudgingly admire. I think his name should be Mark Spartus (I got the name from Tyler’s alarm clock).</p>

	<p>Our Producer: He is some of the young talent that <span class="caps">TPTV</span> is trying to incubate. He was essentially an intern for the mother network, and they sent him to find content, which he assumed meant he was a producer, and because Spartus does not care what happens at <span class="caps">TPTV</span>, the self-imposed title sticks (although it might be funny if the whole network was staffed with people of his same employment level that take themselves far less seriously than he does). He discovered our show at the Indiana University Film Festival and promised us a development deal, which we took to mean was an episode commitment, and which he was not entirely authorized to offer in the first place. He handles us with an air of superiority and mock indifference, which he believes characterizes a TV exec, but he has so little experience in television that his producer schtick is unconvincing. At the same time, he does have genuine excitement about our potential and he does have a genuine zeal for television as a medium, and that sometimes shines through even when he deals with us. He is 100% subordinate and kiss-ass-ish to Spartus, but he also tries to act as if he is Spartus’ go-to guy/right-hand man, a view Spartus does not share. When our producer is forced to interact with us and Spartus at the same time, he hilariously tries to balance his producer act with his ass kissing. I think his name should be Victor Fitzbergh, and he will insist that we call him “Vet.”</p>

	<p>Girl we know/Public Relations spokeswoman for <span class="caps">TPTV</span>: Unlike Vet and most of the people at the network, she will be completely competent and qualified.  She will be in a similar boat to Spartus: legitimately hired by the mother network to work public relations and assigned to <span class="caps">TPTV</span>, only her assignment will make more sense because, although talented, she is young and mostly inexperienced. Her competence will earn her the go-to role for Spartus that Vet envisions himself in. I think it would be best if she were a few years older, so I think our connection to her was that she dated either an older brother of a high school friend (who will not be a character, just a connection) or she dated one of our older friends from high school (perhaps a Stumpe or Stolte-esque character that can make guest appearances. This would also lead to a potentially funny gag wherein the stolte/stumpe character has filmed himself having sex with her, and we have seen the tape). In any case, our paths have crossed many times before, and though she was two or so years older, she always found us hilarious. She will be in our corner, and because her PR duties for this network extend to marketing, she will be intricate in the public success of our show. I think her name should be Jill Winters (mostly because “Ms. Winters” sounds like such a PR name).</p>

	<p>As for my character, I&#8217;m workshopping it. I obviously want it to be cool, but also legit and a part I could play somewhat convincingly. Also, I completely agree about the need for depth in all our characters&#8230;but I&#8217;m working on it. For my first draft, I&#8217;m writing generally stock lines and jokes, and supplementing them as the revisions go along. I think once the story is hammered out, we will find character needs and we can incorporate them into our characters. <br />
