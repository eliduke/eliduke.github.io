        <p>so, victorybrothers.com is not available, and the owner is not interested in selling it (even though he&#8217;s not using it at all).  i did a little more checking, and victorybros.com is also taken.  so, can y&#8217;all think of a good rearrangement of that?  go to <a href="http://www.instantdomainsearch.com">www.instantdomainsearch.com</a> to see if it is available.  if we can&#8217;t think of anything, is it worth changing our name?  just a thought.</p>

        <p>i like that, i think that we are going somewhere with that, but i was wondering about stolen stallion.  do we want to do anything with that?  what was that exactly, our production company?  <a href="http://www.stolenstallion.com">www.stolenstallion.com</a> is available by the way.</p>

        <p>VictoryBrothersInc.com is available, as is TheVictoryBrothers.com, victorybrotherscomedy.com, victorybrothersonline.com, victorybrothersgethotass.com and victorybrothersarefuckingyourgirlfriend.com or &#8220;is&#8221; fucking your girlfriend, depending on your grammar choice.  .  don&#8217;t shorten it to &#8220;bros&#8221; if you don&#8217;t have to.  It&#8217;s not worth changing our name if we can&#8217;t get a website.  that&#8217;s stupid.  </p>

        <p>I think &#8220;VBcomedy.com&#8221; is too close to &#8220;VDcomedy.com&#8221; and, although nothing is as funny as a well-placed venerial disease joke, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a positive association for us. My opinion is moving more and more away from the &#8220;Inc.&#8221; portion of victory brothers. I think I really like I really like The Victory Brothers as our formal name. I think it really works and sounds great</p>

        <p>i&#8217;m really torn about exactly what website it should be, but in the end i don&#8217;t think that i matters too much.  i think that if we can pick something (and it doesn&#8217;t have to have victory brothers in it) and then we just associate ourselves with that.  like hilarioust.com or something like that.  as far as the vb related ones, i&#8217;m more in favor of victorybros.com than any of the others.  oh yeah, and andy, you need to upload a picture of you or else i have no idea who is making comments.</p>

        <p>uber alles, i think i&#8217;m going to have to go with &#8220;victorybrothersinc.com&#8221;  it just feels right, kinda like love between a man and a hooker.  also, you bitches need to be prepared, in the very near future i&#8217;m going to start posting the script for part 1.  i&#8217;d say i&#8217;m excited to hear you thoughts and opinions, but ya&#8217;ll know i&#8217;m a terrible liar.  </p>
