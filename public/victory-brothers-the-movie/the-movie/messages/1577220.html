        <p>so people, although i have not as of yet posted part of the script, rest assured, i am writing it.  i&#8217;ve been chipping away at it for the past few weeks (also drew just dropped off my keys, and i think all of you are fags)</p>

	<p>anyways, what i need, or would like to have at least is suggestions for character traits that your characters will have in the show.  hit me back with some of your thoughts, otherwise i will just create them myself and you may not like it (eli goes hogging all the time)</p>

	<p>examples of what i&#8217;m looking for include the overall demeener,  are they calm, excited nervous?  what do they hate? what do they love?  Also think about how you can demonstrate that your character goes a little bit deeper.  i.e. do they have a soft spot for the homeless?  or what else can elicit a deep, real emotion.  its important that the characters feel three demontional.  they also need to do some changing as the show goes along.  </p>

	<p>i promise, as soon as i get a rough draft of the first part done, i&#8217;ll get it posted for revision.  </p>

	<p>lets not be peyton mannings.  it does us no good to have all the skill in the world only to not finish what we started.  </p>

        <p>Here&#8217;s a little something I just wrote. It is for the beginning and involves some of the interaction between us and the network<br />
This scene will be told by the main characters to the secretary/PR woman they run into after the meeting (I guess only Ty knows about this character. She will be someone who the guys have known in the past, and she now works public relations for our network. She will be our insider help at the network. I really like the function of her character). She asks something like, &#8220;how&#8217;d it go&#8221; and the following dialogue will be revealed as a flashback</p>

 <br />
Executive (to the main characters): Gentlemen, I&#8217;ll be blunt. I find sketch comedy intellectually offensive. (Other producer) showed me some samples of your work, and I did not laugh. Be that as it may, our network is a full slate of programming away from a full slate of programming, and furthermore I understand you&#8217;ve been guarenteed some sort of developmental deal with us. I assure you that I had no part in these promises, and though I am not yet at liberty to discreetly breach these contracts, I have no plans to deal directly with you in any capacity. (Other producer) will go over the pittance we are prepared to offer you for your series. Well, I hope you&#8217;ve found this as brief and marginally irritating as I have. Now, if you&#8217;ll excuse me, I&#8217;ve got a little mud to blow before I play racquetball. <br />
