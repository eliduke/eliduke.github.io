        <p>so as far as i can remember we came up with the idea of making this bitch in about five parts. the parts not necessarily being paced in any particular order. also the part itself can span a week, a day, an hours, you fags get the idea.</p>
        <p>(ty) so here are some parts that we need to think back to when we were smoking and shit and i was thinking a part of an episode could be the process of all of us getting new licences. for example brandon would go to get his while he was all in his goth makeup. or would do the half jaw drop. there is just the idea that its not that often that you get a new id, so when you do you have to make it special. and then through the episode we can discover how different we are and all that bullshit.</p>
        <p>possible names in contention for the overall titile of the aforementioned project. farting the movie, last of the more-drinkins, imitating life or imitating art -either one i think is good and appropriate. however i should mention that brandon heavily favors “last of the moredrinkins”</p>
        <p>also the joke about someone working at a candy shop, and well frankly, hes a fudge packer.</p>
        <p>another thing we need to remember is the sign for a towing company thats on a wall. basically its a picture of a cartoon man standing in an empty parking lot, scratching his head in a quizical manner. the thought bubble coming out of his head says, “I parked in front, but…” and then there will be a picture of a cartoon camel pulling a car with a piece of rope that is tied around his neck, hes looking back over his shoulder smiling, while the rope goes under his body between his legs. And then beneath it all it says “car missing? call camel towing.”</p>
        <p>(ty) ok so i was thinkin about it and this is a really good idea for some shit. an element that i would really like to see in this project is to really focus on making each part have a beginning middle and end. i just read a micheal chriton book and thats pretty much the structure he uses and its fucking awsome. not that that means we have to use it, but i thought that might push those on the fence. and then with the over arching story of “trying to make a movie”</p>
        <p>(ty) oh, also i have a couple of pretty good ideas to start off a couple of the parts of the episode. i want one to start out as a music video where its all of us singing along with the song doing various “seattle” things we do. another one i want the episode to jump in right in the middle of an argument. also i think its a good idea that they all start with a time date and place, not exactly like law and order, i’m thinking white lettering over the video that is playing at the time.</p>
        <p>more later…</p>
        <p>i do think its important that the first part is pretty similar to our first episode simply for the purposses of establishing character and setting.</p>
        <p>what i propose for this “outline” section of the writeboard is just that, an outline. below are five parts, i left two of them without a title just because i have no idea what they should be about, the others i have a vague idea. i think this is a good forum to start throwing out a lot of ideas, at the same time however, thinking about maintaining a few strands of continuity throughout. so if you have a great idea for the “europe” episode, don’t be a bitch, let everyone know about it. this can work.</p>
        <p>my idea would be that once enough ideas have been laid out in this section that someone will take it upon themselves to start an entirely new “writeboard” that is essentially the script for one particular part.</p>
        <p>good night, and good luck.</p>
        <p><strong>PART 1 NEW BEGINNINGS</strong></p>
        <p>- (eli) so, this just came to me a minute ago, and i think that it is a very cool idea. we need to find as many musicians (some we know and some we don’t know) from all over the country and get them to let us use there music for the movie. i was listening to some Room101 today, and their song “Fire Engine Red” would be absolutely perfect for the very beginning of the movie… i can just see it right now. you can listen here (make sure to open it in a new window). and now that i’m listening to some of there other songs, i think that it would be really cool to use more of there stuff. i’m sure we could get nate’s permission to use the songs even though the other two think that drew is a classist. so anyway, can we think of any other bands (aside from well fed which we are free to use) that make music we like that would let us borrow it? that’s what i’m thinking.</p>
        <p>- (eli) i’m thinking that for the beginning we keep it pretty simple. we can show all the main characters doing something that represents who they are and then have some interaction, but build the story in such a way that you really want to keep watching. like, maybe one of the characters is building something but we don’t know what; and someone else is crying but we don’t know why; and so on and so forth. granted we do have to make this section be long enough… but now that i think about it, each section doesn’t have to be exactly 20 mins long. hmmm…</p>
        <p>Me and drew had run through quite a bit with the first episode. it wasn’t so much character development, it was mostly establishing the whole thing with the fictional studio that we were there to make a show, but they weren’t going to pay us to do it. the end of the part was that they needed to get a rough draft very soon and we couldn’t get it done. luckily we ran in to our organic “friend” eli at the pcc and he was able to help us get it done in time. maybe we could mention how brandon was a beautiful beauty queen in there, i don’t know.</p>
        <p>obviously, i think having the big underlying current being that we have to make an episode and that in each episode we are working to get that completed. i think it will be pretty cool because each part will be a slightly different phase of production.</p>
        <p>-(eli) i like this idea. i guess i didn’t realize that there was already a pretty good grasp of the first act or that it was just going to be the first episode that y’all had already hammered out. but i think that is a good theme. it is simple enough, but has enough possibility for depth. so there it is:</p>
        <p>-> “so, what’s your movie about?” </p>
        <p>-> “oh, it’s about some guys that try to make a sitcom and end up doing some really crazy shit trying to get it done, including going to europe. it’s hilarious.”</p>
        <p>(Drew) yeah, to reinforce what tyler was saying, we have a pretty good outline for what would have been the pilot to an actual television series. I think the way we had the pilot start is a really cool film device that could be modified and applied to each section of the movie, and that is, in the original pilot, we had it start in the office of the executives, and their characters are the first ones you meet. The executives included the head of the network and our individual producer (a character reminiscent of that guy that bought us dinner). In this scene, a number of important story/character elements are introduced. First, you get a sense for the executives characters (the concept I like is that our network is a new one founded by a larger parent network, and our network head was a higher-up in this parent company. He had anticipated a promotion within the larger company and was given the head position at this fledgling network, and he is less than enthused. His character waffles between the determination to make this network a success and rub it in the faces of his former bosses and a desire to sink the network to sabotage the investment of the larger network. I think he will have a general level of irritation and skepticism at all times, but the waffling is a trait that can be played with to make an interesting character. The other exec, our producer, will mirror that douche that took us out for dinner. In his interaction with us, he will display a certain level of superiority and self-importance, poorly veiled by that phony hollywood excitement over all of our projects. In his interaction with the head exec, he will be more lap-doggy, because he is in fact young and new to television and eager for our show, his first signing, to be a success).</p>
        <p>From a plot standpoint, starting the film/episode this way means that the movie explains our situation without awkward dialogue between us (“yay, we are in seattle to film our television series for this fledgling network. how exciting”). We had envisioned the episode starting with a conversation between the executives right before our first production meeting with them. Their dialogue will be brief, but establish their characters and provide some exposition. Then it will cut to us in the waiting area, where we will be introduced via a discussion about how excited we are, how much money we are going to make, and how we are going to manhandle these executives to get what we want (I think it’s funny if the ideas about our show that we discuss in this scene clash almost entirely with what the execs discussed in the opening scene). I really like this beginning because it accoplishes things and it is kind of an interesting inversion of character development. I think it is also a re-usable format. One idea that Tyler and I tossed around last night is that time will pass between sections of the film, and that amount of time will vary. We could write a variation of this inverted expository scene for each film segment, and I think that would be a cool stylistic choice.</p>
        <p><strong>PART 2 BLANK</strong></p>
        <p>-i want to bring back the awkward date scenario that we thought up a while ago. maybe we set it up that we needed to film a very awkward date so set up the date to fail.</p>
        <p>-in this part i think it would be appropriate to show a little bit from our jobs. if each of us thinks of a few funny scenes from our jobs we could start the episode with that. for example – for me it would show the kid that comes up and gives me the awkward “bones” everytime, and then i have to yell at a hooker to leave, and they get really surly with me.</p>
        <p>-throwing in the stuff about the job will be good i feel because along with “making the episode” its important to show the characters adapting and evolving throughout the show and the jobs can be a good part of that.</p>
        <p>- (eli) i really like this part. i can see this section just being sort of normal, but really hilarious. it’ll show us doing normal things (like jobs) and not normal things (like filming a sitcom) and wrapped in there will be all kinds of hilarious shit. good stuff. and i just had an idea about the end of the movie, read below for more.</p>
        <p><strong>PART 3 GREEN LAKE</strong></p>
        <p>-mothers with strollers</p>
        <p>-one of them is the mayors wife, we know her secret</p>
        <p>-human squirrels, offer them a dollar</p>
        <p>-the girl smoking and drinking with “you are my hero” playing</p>
        <p><strong>PART 4 BLANK</strong></p>
        <p>-a scene that makes fun of “white noise,” a character hears voices in the noise</p>
        <p>-(andy) don’t do a parody of white noise—no one respects parody. It’s bad enough you’re making a movie about making a movie—don’t sacrifice even more innovation and descend into parody.</p>
        <p>-i think we should steal some of the “chuck norris” things and drop those in here and there, they are fucking halarious.</p>
        <p><strong>PART 5 EUROPE</strong></p>
        <p>-i felt that we could really go out with a bang if we made the climax of the movie also set in europe. the idea of going to europe to film the climax should be something that was mentioned earlier.</p>
        <p><strong>PART 6 THE 1ST EPISODE OF THE SITCOM</strong></p>
        <p>- (eli) now, i know this is new, but hear me out. we don’t even have to have this ready for the rest of the movie, and making it later might even make it funnier. throughout the movie the audience will getting small samplings of things that are going into the sitcom and what it is about and all that crap: they will see us filming certain scenes and here us having brainstorming sessions about things. then we actual show them what the characters have come up with and filmed. the best part is, it will be terrible. we will be able to make fun of so much shit and really lay it on thick. this could be released later on the internet, it could go on the dvd, we could really have some fun with this part.</p>

        <p>Eli, the thing you were mentioning about showing bits of the episode and then showing the episode is a great concept, and we were actually talking about this the other night with reference to the DVD. I think the movie need not necessarily culminate in a single finished episode, but perhaps cover the creation of an season. Most networks sign new shows for partial seasons to test them, and that could be part of the film. We get signed for ten episodes or something like that, and the movie is our year or however long journey through writing, casting, producing and airing these episodes. In this scenario, we never show a full episode, just the snipets or skits, but we constantly reference a complete season 1 DVD, or some collection, which, as we discussed, we could legitimately create and sell through a victorybrothers website. In this sense, the movie makes a character out of the victory broters, but they will actually exist as a sketch comedy group which we can market seperately through their own website. This is why Tyler’s working title “Immitating Life” is absolutely wonderful for this project, because it really is a fictualized version of something that kind of happened. It’s at least a fictionalized version of how we envisioned the real thing to work out, only in Seattle and with more financial backing. So, I love “Immitating Life,” and I also think that the film project should be emphasized as a Stolen Stallion Production, so we can diversify our media empire through one interwoven set of projects. It’ll be awesome.</p>
