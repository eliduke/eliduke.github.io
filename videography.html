    <h2><a href="#mcmurdo_fuels_time_lapse">McMurdo Fuels / South Pole International Film Fest</a></h2>
    <p>My 4th season in Antarctica took me from my normal situation at McMurdo Station to the South Pole Station for my last month. I had been filming little time lapses all season at McMurdo, but then I ended up at the South Pole just in time for their yearly film festival. This video was the only submission from McMurdo, and people jokingly boo'ed with South Pole pride.</p>

    <p>The Washougal River is one of my most favorite places in the whole world, and <a href="http://lunasandals.com" target="_blank">Luna Sandals</a> are perfect way to enjoy it. I go out there at least a half dozen times each summer and I decided to bring my camera along for the ride.</p>

    <p>During my time working with <a href="http://lunasandals.com" target="_blank">Luna Sandals</a> (remotely from Portland), I would occassionally go up to Seattle for a week or a long weekend and help out in the factory. One of the biggest spikes in sales happen just after Christopher McDougall mentioned Luna Sandals on the Don Imus show. Strange, but awesome. Anyhoo, during my time in the factory I filmed different moments and different angles and it came together nicely. They have since moved into a different factory and the process is quite a bit different now. Maybe it's time for me to go up to Seattle again and put in some quality time at the factory.</p>

    <h2><a href="#children_of_men_bling_theatre">"Children of Men" by Bling Theatre</a></h2>
    <p>In my humble opinion, this is one of the best music videos ever made. Being the creator of this video and being friends with <a href="http://blingtheatre.bandcamp.com" target="_blank">Bling Theatre</a>, I realize that you must think I am biased. Trust me, I'm not. This is just pure genius, simple as that. I call it like I see it, man.</p>

    <p>My homies <a href="http://lamprey.bandcamp.com" target="_blank">Lamprey</a> in their practice space at AudioCinema in Portland, OR. In this single, continuous shot, you can really experience the progression of the music. It was one of many tests with the new filming rig in preparation for the 3rd Annual <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ceremonyofsludge" target="_blank">Ceremony of Sludge</a>. I had a great time being part of the video crew.</p>

    <p>This is what I came home to one night. I didn't start filming until at least a minute into the charade.</p>
