    <p>My 4th season in Antarctica took me from my normal situation at McMurdo Station to the South Pole Station for a month. I had been filming little time lapses all season at McMurdo, but then I ended up at the South Pole just in time for their yearly film festival. This video was the only submission from McMurdo. </p>

    <p>During my time working with Luna Sandals (remotely from Portland), I would occassionally go up to Seattle for a week or maybe a long weekend to help out in the factory. One of the biggest spikes in sales happen just after Christopher McDougall mentioned Luna Sandals on the Don Imus show. Strange, but awesome. Anyhoo, during my time in the factory I filmed different moments and different angles and it came together nicely. They have since moved into a different factory and the process is quite a bit different now. Maybe it's time for me to go up to Seattle again and get in some quality factory time.</p>

    <p>In my humble opinion, this is one of the best music videos ever made. I realize, being the creator of said video, that you must think I am biased. Trust me, I'm not. This is just pure genius, simple as that. I call it like I see it, man.</p>

    <p>This is what I came home to one night. I didn't start filming until at least a minute into the charade.'</p>
