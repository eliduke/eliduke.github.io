    <p class="p-summary">This cake recipe is one of my parlor tricks. It is so dead simple, and it just happens to be vegan! It uses very basic ingredients that you probably already have in your kitchen, and you will surprise all your guests, vegan or not. I've had lots of people tell me it was the best chocolate cake they've ever had. It's moist and light. You'll love it.</p>
    <p class="p-summary">I first learned about this recipe from my mother. She was hunting around in her old recipes for vegan ones and found this gem, a callback to her college years. She learned it from her mother, who learned it from her mother, all the way back. Turtles all the way down. It is believed that this cake evolved during World War II when milk and eggs were being rationed.</p>
