    <p class="p-summary">I first discovered this recipe in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/New-Farm-Vegetarian-Cookbook/dp/0913990604" target="_blank">New Farm Vegetarian Cookbook</a>, and you will not find a better recipe for Vegan Mac &amp; Cheeze. Vegans and non-vegans alike will enjoy this hot dish, but don't expect it to taste exactly like Mac &amp; Cheese. Instead, just think of it as another delicious, savory casserole that you put in your mouth. Yum.</p>
    <p class="p-summary">Don't be afraid to use whole wheat noodles and whole wheat flour. It still tastes amazing, is way better for you, and it's got that nice, hearty texture. Also, I prefer the flavor of Bragg's Liquid Aminos, but Soy Sauce works just fine.
    <p class="p-summary">Everything fits snuggly in a 9" x 13" pan.</p>

    <h3>Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="list-unstyled">
      <li class="p-ingredient">7 Cups of Uncooked Macaroni</li>
      <li class="p-ingredient">1 Cup of Flour</li>
      <li class="p-ingredient">3 Tsp of Salt</li>
      <li class="p-ingredient">3 Tsp of Garlic Powder</li>
      <li class="p-ingredient">A Pinch of Tumeric</li>
      <li class="p-ingredient">2 Cups of Nutritional Yeast</li>
      <li class="p-ingredient">Cayenne Pepper (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li class="p-ingredient">1 Cup of Olive Oil</li>
      <li class="p-ingredient">7 Cups of Boiling Water</li>
      <li class="p-ingredient">4 Tbsp of Braggs or Soy Sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol class="e-instructions">
      <li>Cook the macaroni, then strain, rinse, and set aside. If you've got a couple big pots you can do things simultaneously, but that might be a bit much on your first go 'round.</li>
      <li>In a <em>large</em> pot, heat the olive oil on medium low and then slowly add the flour, mixing continuously with a whisk to keep it nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>Pour in the boiling water very slowly, stirring continuously. You will start to see the contents expand <strong>and thicken</strong>! You are making a roux (pronounced <em>roo</em>) and they are like magic.</li>
      <li>After you've added all of the boiling water and everything is nice and smooth, add the salt, Braggs, garlic powder, and tumeric. Give it a couple good stirs.</li>
      <li>Add the nutritional yeast slowly, stirring continuously. The sauce will thicken up again.</li>
      <li>Add the cooked noodles to the sauce and stir, and then pour the entire thing into a 9" x 13" pan.</li>
      <li>At this point I like to sprinkle the top of the casserole with cayenne pepper. It gives it some nice color and adds a subtle little spice to the whole thing. I usually give it a good covering.</li>
      <li>Bake at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes, then broil for about 10 minutes to make the top all nice and crispy.</li>
    </ol>
