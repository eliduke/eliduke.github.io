  <p>Heeeeeeeeey!</p>

  <p>Got plans on Saturday the 28th? DO YA?!</p>

  <p>Wanna come to a floating home (flome) house party down in Oregon City?!</p>

  <p>It’s gonna be an all-day-and-into-the-night kind of gathering, so you can arrive early or late, stay for a while or just pop in for a bit.</p>

  <p>It’s probably gonna be too cold to swim, but maybe you like it brisk?! There might be a canoe or paddle board if you’re feeling frisky (bring one if you got it), but mostly we’re just gonna be chilling by the water, hanging out on the deck, maybe playing a game, having some snacks and refreshing drinks, and taking in the grandeur of a house just floatin’ right there on the ding dang river! What a world! Please feel free to bring a snack and/or drink to share. Also, there’s a couple options for crashing on a couch or in a cozy little loft, so bring a toothbrush, a sleeping bag, and your PJs if you wanna slumber party.</p>

  <p>When you arrive, there will be a smallish gravel parking lot that you are free to park in! If that’s full, grab some street parking nearby and walk your lil tushy in. From the parking lot you’ll take a small walking path over some train tracks, then walk down the ramp and all the way back through the little fence. Please call me when you arrive if you are feeling confused or lost in anyway.</p>

  <p>Let me know if you plan on attending, so I can get a rough estimate on numbers. Thanks!</p>
