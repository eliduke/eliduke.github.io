  <p><em>Heeeeeeeeey!</em></p>

  <p>Got plans on <em>Saturday, Sept 28th</em>?</p>

  <p>Wanna come to a floating home (flome) house party down in Oregon City?!</p>

  <p>It’s gonna be an all-day-and-into-the-night kind of gathering, so you can arrive early or late, stay for a while or just pop in for a bit.</p>


  <p>It’s probably gonna be too cold to swim, but maybe you like it brisk?! There might be a canoe or paddle board if you’re feeling frisky (bring one if you got it), but mostly we’re just gonna be chilling by the water, hanging out on the deck, maybe playing a game, having some snacks and refreshing drinks, and taking in the grandeur of a house just floatin’ right there on the ding dang river! What a world! Please feel free to bring a snack and/or drink to share. Also, there’s a couple options for crashing on a couch or in a cozy little loft, so bring a toothbrush, a sleeping bag, and your PJs if you wanna slumber party.</p>

  <h4>GETTING HERE & PARKING</h4>

  <p>When you arrive, there will be a smallish gravel parking lot that <strong>YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO PARK IN</strong>. You must go about 100 yards further south to the large parking / pull off / scenic lookout area on the north side of the road. You can park there! If that’s full, keep looking for other street parking nearby and walk your lil tushy in. If you have accessibility needs and would like to park in the smallish gravel lot, let me know. I can totally make that happen.</p>
  <p>From the gravel lot, walk past the stop sign and across the train tracks. <strong>THIS IS AN UNCONTROLLED CROSSING. LOOK BOTH WAYS!</strong> Once you cross the tracks, then walk down the ramp and all the way back on the boardwalk to 905 A. It’s the blue house just inside the chain-link fence gate. Please call me when you arrive if you are feeling confused or lost in anyway!</p>

  <p>Let me know if you plan on attending, so I can get a rough estimate on numbers. Thanks!</p>
